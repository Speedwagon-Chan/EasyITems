This mod offers more variety for shoes in the game. You start out with a low tier shoe (which can be crafter with basic materials) and work this shoe up to its fullest potential!

This mod contains:
* A starter shoe
* Class related shoes (Mage, Melee, Ranged, Thrower and Summoner)
* Upgraded versions of the Frostspark boots

THIS MOD ONLY WORKS IF YOU PLAY ON EXPERT MODE WITH A CORRUPTION BIOME!
